# Otoshidama Envelope

This is a PDF pattern for an otoshidama envelope. On New Year's Day in Japan,
children traditionally receive a gift of money from their parents and
grandparents, called 'otoshidama'.

Usually otoshidama is presented in a special decorated envelope, but this year
we didn't get any of those, so I decided to make them myself.

The file `envelope.pdf` is two pages, formatted for US letter paper. The colored
flower goes on the outside; the marks on the other side show where to cut and
fold the envelope. I followed the directions for “How to make an envelope 3:
Petit Envelope” at [origami land].
